##### Trains a model to predict contract success based on project performance. #####
##### Features: Project Deadline (days), Work Quality Score, Payment Timeliness #####
##### Target: Contract Success Score (0-100) #####
##### Model: Linear Regression #####
##### Save model as "contract_performance.pkl" #####
##### Usage: evaluate_contract_performance(deadline, quality_score, payment_timeliness) #####
##### Returns: Predicted contract success score #####
##### Example: evaluate_contract_performance(45, 80, 1) #####
##### Expected Output: Predicted success score #####
##### This AI model predicts contract success based on project performance metrics such as deadline adherence, work quality, and payment timeliness. #####
