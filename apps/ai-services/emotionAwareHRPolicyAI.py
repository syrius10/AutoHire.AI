##### AI model predicting HR policy based on emotional data. #####
##### HR Policy Recommendations: Standard Policy (0), Adaptive Policy (1) #####
##### Features: Stress Level, Workload, Job Satisfaction, Productivity #####
##### Target: HR Policy (1 = Adaptive Policy, 0 = Standard Policy) #####
##### Sample dataset: [Stress Level, Workload, Job Satisfaction, Productivity] -> HR Policy Recommendation #####
##### AI-driven emotion-aware HR policies & adaptive work scheduling. #####
##### This model analyzes employee emotions, stress levels, and productivity trends to recommend personalized HR policies and adaptive scheduling strategies. #####
