##### Trains a model to predict employee wellness based on work-life balance factors. #####
##### Features: Stress Level, Sleep Hours, Work Hours, Workload #####
##### Target: Wellness Score (Higher is better) #####
##### AI-driven wellness monitoring and stress management. #####
##### This model continuously monitors employee stress levels, workload, and self-reported wellness metrics to provide personalized well-being recommendations. #####
